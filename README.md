# Movie-Success-Prector
GMM movie success predictor  

A data science final project, that I worked on with my partner Joe Rizzo. The purpose of which was to use a gmm to help us see what upcoming movies could be successful based on the previous movies that fit our definition of success which was profit. We got a lot of movie data and sifted through it using pandas. We visualized it and determined what data on each movie we could actually use. We ended up using things that could easily be turned into numbers months for example or that were already numbers. We then ran that through a GMM of multiple k values to see what groups we could find. Once we were satisfied with our groupings we color code them  and set them in different charts and graphs to draw up some conclusions. 

Somethings that would could have done was classify them movies differently maybe different algorithm, perhaps a way to include other things that and be put into numbers. Like the place where it was released, having a director and movie stars. Factors which I do believe will affect the success of a movie.
